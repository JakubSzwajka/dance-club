      text: I took 3 trial studies at the nolimits dance school and each time there
        was a problem. At the beginning, the group did not open due to too few people
        willing to join, but when I finally joined the group, it was overcrowded.
        The next time the classes could not be started due to a system error, my partner
        and I were supposed to be registered from the middle of the course that we
        had started earlier, but we were kicked out. (It didn't work halfway through,
        even though I asked at the beginning and it was supposed to be possible).
        And finally, despite having an active pass, I was not allowed into the classes
        because the package was apparently assigned to other classes (those from which
        we were withdrawn) and had expired. I wasted a lot of time talking to the
        consultant who assured me that I could use the package for other classes and
        it would start when I went to the first class. I arrived and it turned out
        that it had expired, so either the consultant or the receptionists were incompetent.

        level is great, he conducts classes professionally. Unfortunately, recent
        organizational situations on the part of the reception have influenced my
        negative opinion and I am wondering whether to go to the competition.

        I travel to classes by car, so I have to spend some time traveling... so a
        week ago on Friday, I was surprised when I found out at the reception that
        "salsa classes were canceled that day". I also found out that e-mails with
        this message were sent... 60 minutes before the classes... I was not happy
        with the situation but I went home.

        A few days ago I received information that the group was disbanded and today
        was the last class (photo). The classes were at 5 p.m. - to make sure the
        classes would take place, I called the reception an hour before they started.

        "Good morning, I am registered for solo salsa at 5 p.m., but a few days ago
        I received an e-mail that today is the last class and the group will be closed.
        I would like to make sure whether there are classes today or not?"

        On the phone I heard "yes, the classes will take place today, but there is
        an exceptional situation and there will be a replacement for the teacher -
        the classes will be conducted by another person"

        I asked if the accompanying person was not registered (and could not register
        online because the group was blocked) if he could come and register on the
        spot - the receptionist replied that of course he could.


        After arriving there, it turned out that there were NO classes and nothing
        was known about a replacement. They didn''t even send e-mails with information
        - and sent the entire group of people home. For me it is absurd that the dance
        school does not inform that the classes will not take place - even more -
        it writes an e-mail that the classes WILL take place. And what''s worse -
        an hour before the start, the reception ensures that the classes will take
        place normally, and when someone arrives, they say "you can go to another
        class in an hour."


        It has absolutely nothing to do with professionalism. It would seem that in
        such a situation some form of compensation would be offered (e.g. a voucher
        for classes, which would not cost the school anything...) but it is better
        to laugh in someone''s face that the classes will not take place.


        This is my personal opinion, I only focused on the reception service - when
        it comes to, for example, bachata which I go to, I recommend it. Unfortunately,
        Google does not allow you to divide opinions into categories.'

      text: I highly do not recommend the No Limits school for organizing a hen party.
        I submitted the application on time, it was accepted, and just before the
        date of the hen party (less than 3 days), after several attempts to contact
        me (because I did not receive any information on this matter for 10 days),
        we were refused the event. Very unprofessional behavior, considering that
        in the meantime I did not receive any information regarding any problems with
        the organization or even a proposal to change the type of dance/time of the
        hen party. My friends and I were left out in the cold just before one of us
        had such an important day.

        Joanna helped us to learn two performances: one is first dance, which was

        we wanted to implement during the entrance to the wedding venue and again
        she helped us a lot with that.


        Apart from that Joanna is very supportive person, who helped us with some

        as well as weekend workshops with Korean instructors who create choreographies
        on a daily basis and cooperate with the largest K-pop bands. In addition,
        students have many opportunities to participate in other activities organized
        by the school - camps for children and adults, dance shows, and the recently
        held first edition of the Korean festival.

        The lovely atmosphere and the instructors'' involvement in the development
        of this place make you want to be here and participate in such a wonderful

        there is an opportunity to take part in a casting and join one of the closed
        groups that record covers on YouTube and participate in nationwide dance competitions.
        In addition, the school organizes regular dance workshops to which it invites
        famous Korean choreographers who have created choreographies for the biggest
        K-pop stars.

        The website is very clear, and every week there is a schedule of choreography
        taught by scholars in specific classes.

        An additional advantage is free parking

      text: I highly recommend the school, especially Dominican bachata classes with
        Damian. Great atmosphere, interesting facts about both dance and the Dominican
        Republic itself - you can see that this is something she really likes, so
        we feel that she is trying to instill in us the love for this dance. Apart
        from that, a lot of fun and a very nice group of participants :)

      text: I have been taking bachata classes for 3 months and I am satisfied with
        the classes with Damian. Damian is a professional with a great passion for
        traditional bachata and the Dominican Republic itself. During each class,
        apart from new figures, we learn interesting facts about the island and the
        Dominican people. Damian focuses primarily on practical dance skills, i.e.
        conducting and feeling the music, which is also useful in other styles. There
        is a family atmosphere during the classes, and the other participants are
        very helpful in learning new steps. I can wholeheartedly recommend this dance
        school.

      text: 'From the technical side, I have no objections - the classes allowed me
        to learn the basics of dance and acquire new skills. In my opinion, they lacked
        energy and dynamics, which, combined with the lack of a stable group (frequent
        absences of participants and lack of dancing partners), resulted in a lack
        of comfort in learning.


        I didn''t feel good during the classes, so I decided to end my participation
        before completing the 3-month course (bachata).'

      text: 'It''s supposed to be pleasant during classes - and that''s all there
        is to it. Unfortunately, groups merge very often, the trainer is often absent
        and classes are postponed to other dates (often different days). There is
        not even an attempt to swap assistants to keep the day the same. Merging groups
        means that 7-year-old children dance together with 3-year-olds... :/ overall,
        very poor organization and it is clear that many things are not well done.
        I have the impression that the only thing that matters is obtaining funds
        and there is no commitment to maintaining at least a relative level of organization
        of classes.

        This is so discouraging that I doubt we will decide to take part in, for example,
        summer camps or further classes next year.'

        All smaller performances or larger events ended with successes and happy memories
        with lots of happy stories. I don't understand the attitude of some people
        in other opinions, because I think they say things that are not entirely true

        to ask the coach about the time of the performance, and she closed the door
        in my face. Even though I asked the reception to tell the trainer that we
        expected contact on key issues, nothing changed. The highlight is the trainer''s
        complaints that the child is doing his homework (and we confirmed the date),
        and in addition, she was directing her complaints at the child who did not
        know how to defend himself.


        The reception employs polite people, but we often received text messages saying
        "we remind you that training...", when in fact it was the first information
        that reached us, and not any reminder. I also don''t know if it is very professional
        that, while waiting for the end of the class, I can listen closely to a loud
        conversation about who paid and who did not pay for a certain trip (names

      text: I took my first classes completely by accident, but it turned out to be
        one of the best accidents of my life. The place itself is very aesthetic and
        pleasing to the eye, and the atmosphere there makes you feel incredibly comfortable.
        The entire team is so passionate about tubing that it makes you want to come
        back. Classes with Nina are a hit, because you can learn not only complicated
        figures, but also the flow that makes the whole thing more effective, but
        you can also count on great support and attention to detail :) I recommend
        it to everyone, I didn't think so that I will like pole dancing so much, but
        thanks to the hashtag classes, I can't imagine it being any different now

      text: 'I recommend Hashtag Pole Dance to everyone who feels tempted to try it,
        but wonders "Is it for me? Will I be able to handle it? How will I feel if
        I am completely new to the subject?"


        The girls who run this place create a fantastic atmosphere from the first
        contact - you immediately feel welcome, even though you don''t know anyone
        yet :)

        Moreover, they teach very well - from the basics, step by step. You can feel
        the progress from month to month.


        The best answer to the question whether this sport is for me is to answer
        for yourself. But Hashtag certainly provides great conditions to find out

      text: Yesterday I attended my first "Pole dance from scratch" class with the
        trainer Ada and I really liked it, the instructor showed how to perform a
        given figure and helped when someone needed protection. After stretching with
        the instructors Patrycja and Nina, I noticed the effects after the first class,
        just a few hours after the exercises I started to "feel" all the stretched
        parts, even the abdominal muscles. Hashtag Pole Dance is a very cool place
        where you can combine complementary training with pole dancing :)

      text: 'When it comes to pole dancing, Patryk and Mateusz are simply irreplaceable.
        These are two fearless souls who not only provide incredible fun, but also
        show the world that pole dancing is not only the domain of one gender! üòÑ As
        a regular visitor to their school, I must admit that it is not only a great
        training for the body, but also for the spirit. Pole dancing gives me self-confidence,
        lots of laughter and friendships for life, all thanks to Patryk and Mateusz,
        who together with us destroy all stereotypes. Pole Dance House is a place
        where everyone can feel comfortable and amazing! I love you all for the wonderful
        atmosphere we create together. Our school is not only a place where we improve
        our pole skills, but also a place where we create a real family.


        Therefore, if you are considering pole dancing, don''t waste your time - Patryk
        and Mateusz will teach you how to be a real superstar on the pole! üåüüöÄ'

      text: I am happy and extremely grateful that I could come to such a wonderful
        place. This is my first and, I think, last Pole Dance school where I have
        been practicing for 1.5 years. The atmosphere in the classes is really great,
        instructors Patryk and Mateusz are demanding trainers, but at the same time
        great people. There are no better or worse people here, everyone gets the
        same amount of attention and help when needed. Before coming to the classes,
        I was very afraid that I wouldn't be able to cope and that I would be left
        behind from the group, nothing could be further from the truth. Now it's my
        favorite place, thanks to which I gained self-confidence, a bigger bicep :D,
        and most importantly, I met valuable people who share a common passion:) I
        recommend it with all my heart!
